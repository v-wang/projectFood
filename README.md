===========

Foodie Forum provides a friendly user interface where users can follow other users based on various taste profiles.
Restaurants and overall places to eat populate the recommended text box of the newsfeed page along with top contributors 
of that area.

Area is based on the zipcode/area you are currently in.  To become a top contributor, users will have to 'star' or 'upvote'
a specific user.  Once a user gains enough of a following, he/she is considered a top contributor.
